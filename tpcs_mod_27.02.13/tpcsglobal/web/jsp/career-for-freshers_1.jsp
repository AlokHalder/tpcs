                    <h2><font color="#800000">Career For Freshers (Freshers Must Read it)</font></h2>
                    <p>The Professional Consultancy Services (TPCS) is pioneer company which have three departments IT Services ,Consulting and Corporate Training .Currently we are working in Kolkata &amp; Siliguri location . </p>
                    
                   <p>We have started our journey in the year 2006 and have past 6 years plus of experience in Software Development &amp; Corporate Training arena and from 2010 we have started to provide consulting service to industry</p>
                    <p>We do not offer any normal training courses to freshers who have passed out BE,B-Tech, MCA . Rather we trained them rigorushly with current technologies like J2EE,.NET, PHP/MySQL by our own Senior Software Developers  who have 5-10 years of industry experience . </p> 
                    <p>We prepare freshers developer to grow into as promising software professionals who are truly skilled have ability to take any challenges in Software development Jobs </p>
                    <p>Every year Engineering Institutes producing thousands of freshers who are looking an entry to IT Industry simultaneously. Some freshers are lucky to getting job opportunity in campus placement . But who are not getting Job in campus it is really hard to get an entry in the industry untill unless they are well efficient with any one of technologies like Java /J2ee, .NET, Php-MySql. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>Industry works on using thousands of technologies but freshers who have not got job in campus their path is narrow they have to start their career any of the technologies like Java/J2EE, PHP/MySQL, .NET , Oracle technologies until unless they do not go to a branded companies or an MNC</p>
                    
                    <p>Since actual clients software development task is comparatively more complex than small project development during college campus , company prefers people who knows minimum level of technologies and candidate who have better logic sense still they are freshers .</p>
                    
                    <p>There are also huge training cost,infrastructure, human effort factors necessary to convert freshers to a skilled IT Professional who will be efficient with technologies in IT industry standard which is practically not possible to bear by small & middle size companies . This scenario makes more tough to start career for freshers to get an entry point in the industry . Many freshers get also cheated by some fake organization with current scenario .</p> 
                    
                    <p>Freshers have to keep in mind that there is no short cut way or miracle or back-door entry to grow in your career. You need to be passionate ,motivated and have to love with technologies & then you will enjoy what you will learn .Untill unless you know at least any recent technologies well it is really tough to get a job in big  MNC .</p>
                    
                    <p> If you do not get job in campus it does not mean that your career is ruined or end . Do not be demotivated looking who have got job in campus . Do not be energies looking who have got job by short-cut method,bribe or forgery .There are enough space for all but you need to prepare yourself first. Do n't hurry up too much here & there . </p>
                   
                     <p>Keep patients upon your strength it may required 5-6 months and in worst case 1-2 years to start an IT career. Try to be skilled & efficient at least any one of technologies like J2EE/NET/PHP-MySQL/Oracle not all. Try to find a small company & stay there at least 1 -2 years there , in parallel develop your skills & knowledge .At this stage do not prioritize upon money/salary at all , rather concentrate focus to learn job only. Job/Skills can't purchase by money using back-door entry at all. When you will be enough skilled professional ,job with reasonable salary will search you automatically, you will not to be required to search job and better pay package. </p>
                    
                    <p>Miracle to get a job happened in College Campus Interviews Only , but after campus to get job you have to learned any of technologies like Java,.Net,Php/MySQL very well with huge effort ,concentration, dedication,sincerity ,motivation and passion also . If you have hurry to get a job by short-cut method by applying huge money there are high chances to cope up with Fake Companies also. Be logical & realistic before accept any offer from a company & check backgrounds of the company.Don't be blind follower only! A company can offer you 10k-20k monthly while you are able to generate revenue 30k-60k monthly. Only big MNC's can bear it for freshers. One freshers cann't generate such amount of revenue within 6 months in his/her career. Hence be aware about industry !
                    <p>We provide on job training to only selected candidates after rounds of technical & non technical interviews and engaged to actually all live software development of our own and clients company work/job so that freshers can get an on job experience how an web development company work in real world . It requires very hard work & sincere effort to learn new technologies and methodologies. No sort cut solution does not work here.</p>
